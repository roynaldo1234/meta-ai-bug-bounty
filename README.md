## Introduction

In the age of AI, security remains a critical concern. This report aims to highlight significant vulnerabilities within Meta AI's systems, specifically focusing on Instagram Group Chat. By identifying these issues, we contribute to a safer digital environment.

## Vulnerabilities

### Prompt Injection

Prompt injection occurs when an attacker manipulates the input to influence the behavior of an AI model. In our findings, we demonstrated how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in Instagram Group Chat. 

#### Example Scenario

An attacker sends a carefully crafted message that alters the model's output, potentially leading to harmful or misleading responses. This can be particularly damaging in group settings where misinformation can spread rapidly.

### Command Execution

Command execution vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a system. We discovered that Instagram Group Chat could be manipulated to perform unauthorized actions.

#### Example Scenario

An attacker could send a message that triggers a command execution, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform malicious actions. This poses a significant risk to users and the platform's integrity.

## Methodology

Our approach involved a systematic examination of the Instagram Group Chat's architecture. We employed both automated tools and manual testing to uncover vulnerabilities. Key steps included:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the system's architecture and components.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using tools to identify potential weaknesses.
3. **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to confirm their existence.
4. **Reporting**: Documenting findings and providing recommendations for remediation.

## Impact

The implications of these vulnerabilities are far-reaching. Successful exploitation could lead to:

- Data breaches
- Misinformation spread
- Loss of user trust
- Regulatory scrutiny

It is crucial for Meta AI to address these vulnerabilities promptly to maintain the integrity of their platforms.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure practices. Upon discovering these vulnerabilities, we notified Meta AI and provided them with a detailed report. We encourage others to follow this approach to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed without putting users at risk.
